All is well.  VARIK does not claim to be an artist, either.

> If you want more detailed praise, I would say you put a lot of time into getting the pattern into the fur using different stroke directions, and I can see that. You may wish to use a more dynamic pose for future drawings, but as a reference this is good (pattern is not stretched).
VARIK's movements are rather stilted.  Because the depicted character is a representation of VARIK, the character's movements are generally stilted, as well.  However, because exceptions exist, some relatively dynamic stuff may still be created.
In any case, the criticism is appreciated.

> Side note, as an avid user of Spacemacs, even I have trouble reading a wall of text. Consider refining future posts with more newlines, or in the case of copyrights, use a SPDX identifier so someone doesn't need to go hunting for it.
Newlines are present; VARIK greatly dislikes long paragraphs.  The plaintext version of this reply is visible at [LINK], although some line breaks are actually ADDED to the Reddit response for the sake of separating paragraphs and replies to such paragraphs.
Spacemacs or Reddit must delete some newlines; the lines of the original text are reasonably short.
Because the licence under which this thing is released is currently being decided, no SPDX identifier is placed.  VARIK leans toward using the Unlicense but wishes to make this move only after the drawing is certainly released into the public domain.
Regarding the choice of text editor: Using ed(1) is always an option.\*  Just be sure to RTFM.  http://man.openbsd.org/ed.1

Cut the shit.  Skills are developed through failure.

> [...] but the shading on your character helps accentuate the 3D nature, it's good.
The shading is actually initially considered to be a potential weak point of the drawing; VARIK's previous drawings tend to feature relatively heavy, exaggerated shading.  This drawing is the first thing which features some ~~realistic shading~~ shading which is not _completely_ exaggerated.


\*This option, however, is not for men who are faint of heart or easily bored.
